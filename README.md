# 🏅 Mental Health Support for Athletes

## 🥇 First Place at Code For All_ Bootcamp Hackathon

This project was developed in 24 hours during the Code For All_ Bootcamp Hackathon, where our team secured first place! The challenge was to create a Single Page Application (SPA) with the theme "Olympic Games" and the song "Survival" by Muse.

Our team of five decided to address a crucial issue: **mental health among athletes**. The intense pressure faced by athletes can lead to serious mental health challenges, including depression and suicidal thoughts. Our application provides resources and support for athletes who are struggling with these issues.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

### 🎯 Objective

Create a web application (SPA) focused on supporting the mental health of athletes, helping them cope with the immense pressure they face, and offering resources to prevent depression and suicide.

### 🌟 Features

Our application offers four main services designed to support athletes' mental health:

1. **Test for Help:** A quiz that helps athletes determine if they need professional help based on their mental state.
2. **Schedule an Appointment:** A feature that allows athletes to schedule appointments with mental health specialists.
3. **Talk with a Professional:** A chat service where athletes can talk directly with mental health professionals or connect with other athletes.
4. **Help a Friend:** A tool to send an anonymous letter to a friend who might need mental health support, encouraging them to seek help.

### 🧩 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Deployment:** Netlify

### 🚀 Methodology

We employed Agile methodology, focusing on rapid iteration and continuous improvement. The project was broken down into several user stories, and we worked in 2-hour sprints to ensure steady progress and quick problem-solving. This approach allowed us to meet our objectives within the tight 24-hour timeframe.

### 💡 Inspiration

The theme of the hackathon, combined with the powerful message of Muse's "Survival," inspired us to focus on the mental resilience required by athletes. Our application aims to provide much-needed support to those who endure immense pressure and, in doing so, raise awareness about the importance of mental health in sports.
